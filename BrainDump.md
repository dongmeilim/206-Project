* Window layout (what every window should have)
  * Home Button on top left (Except for Menu)
  * Back Button on bottom left (Except for Menu)
  * Next Button on bottom right (Where appropriate)
  * Help Button on top right 
    * Should switch to a scene that describes what the window does, detailed with pictures but spaced out. Perhaps use AnchorPane.
  
* Make resizable, should be done by having Box as the Parent of the Scene
* Have a reset button for wikit text
* When you pause the video - save the time, when you play the video, load the time
* Home button visible on all screens
* Bind buttons for everything
* Preview video before saving
* Voice names - more descriptive (kaldiphone means nothing to the user)
* Audio select needs to be larger(checkboxes) 
* Warn the user preemptively that the NZ voice cant pronounce a lot of words.

Mock-stakeholde requirement

Client: A child user (7-10 years)

* Bright colours - beach or glade/meadow image background
* Help as described above

General feedback about the presentation

PROS

* Everyone did the functionality
* Introduced themselves
* Rehearsed and confident - interactivity between client and dev (what would you like to put in)
* Previewing capacity - for audio, images
* Well thought out video players
* Thoughts about the look and feel
* Enabling buttons when necessary
* Key bindings
* Opening screen

CONS

* Hadn't necessarily thought about the ease of the word flow
* needed to save files each time - can it not be automated?
* Cluttered screens with multiple functionality
* Audio list should either show the text or media controls to play the audio?
* App should be called VARpedia
* Default values for options - which the user can go change
* Predict saved video/audio names and change it if the file already exists
* Text size needs to be consistent [[[Check AudioSelect]]] for accessibility
* Who's the audience - justify your decisions
* Sometimes shortcuts were needed - this would be only known by technical people.
* Play with the font color, size, family and buttons - make it not Javaish
* If the search box is empty, why the user can press button.
* Difference between close and cancel, be specific
* Specifically say "Click the images to select" [[[ImageSelect]]]
* Descriptive names for voices - what does kaldiphone mean?
* What's the difference between kaldiphone and the nz one? Show why the choice matters.
* Let the user know what's going on when heavy tasks have started: Spinning things, progress bars etc

to be thought about for quiz:

1. Beep out the search term of the audio
User must enter in the search term
2. Options:
  * Audio + Images
  * Audio only
  * Images only

E.g. \*\*\*\* has three requirements for combustion. Heat, fuel and oxygen.
User would guess: Fire

It should be made clear that the quality of the quiz is dependent on the quality of the creation
e.g. should users be discouraged from making  a creation of only one word, etc?
if audio in the creation does not contain the search term should it be discouraged also?

We should clarify in the Search bar with a label: `What would you like to learn about today?`

Should we force the user to explictly save the audio? Requiring the kid to do too much steps would be a pain in the neck.

Should we split up the text into pages?
