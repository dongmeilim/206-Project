VARpedia is an application that allows you to create visual, 
aural, and readable creations for wikipedia entries. It is
targeted towards children aged 7-10 years.

From the main menu, you can choose to create a video, watch a 
video or play the quiz.

At any point in the application where there is a "?" button in
the top-right corner, you can click it to get clear instructions
for that window!

Use the back and next buttons in the bottom corners to navigate
the creation windows. Use the home button in the top left corner
to return to the main menu.

Enjoy!
