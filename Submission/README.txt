==========================Installation=======================

To run the application, please ensure that runnable.jar
is in the same directory as scripts and flickr-api-keys.txt.
It should already be there when you download it.

Then open the terminal and run the jar file using:

java -jar runnable.jar


============================VARpedia=========================

VARpedia is an application that allows you to create visual, 
aural, and readable creations for wikipedia entries.

From the main menu, you can choose to create a video, watch a 
video or play the quiz.

At any point in the application where there is a "?" button in
the top left corner, you can click it to get clear instructions
for that window!

Use the back and next buttons in the bottom corners to navigate
the creation windows.

Enjoy!
