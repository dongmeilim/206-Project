# Summary of Peer Review Feedback

## From Reviewer 1: The PDF

### Code Quality

High ratings.

**Comment**

Good use of many small classes to handle individual tasks and minimise code duplication. The clear package structure also gives your project very clean design. The clear package layout and consistent and code convention and comments make the code very readable. One thing that I am missing from the readme is an indication of what platform this application should be run on.

## Tidyness

* Unnecessary files are not deleted.
* Program exits cleanly

**Comment**

After closing the application, there still remains a directory name “tmp” that contains the intermediate files for creating a creation. From my understanding and by the name of the directory, I believe that this directory is meant to be removed after closure of the application.

## Ease of Use

High ratings.

**Comment**

I really appreciate the simplicity of the error messages when the application receives unexpected input. Another standout feature that improves the ease of use is the consistent question mark help function, which is very aesthetically implemented and really benefits the user.

## Look and Feel

High ratings.

**Comment**

I have not seen any indication of what the target user is, however, I am assuming that it is for children. The general look and feel is very refined all around, with fitting colours, suitable and easyto-read font, and quality details, such as shadows and subtle gradients. You have a great looking application!

## Learning Component

No comments due to inability to create creations.

## Broken functionality

I am testing the application on the linux desktop on the ECSE lab computers. The application works flawlessly up until I finish selecting images and click the next arrow. The loading circle fills up and then the tick appears. At this point, the GUI does not progress onto the next scene, and the following error is thrown in the terminal:

`javafx.fxml.LoadException:`
`file:/afs/ec.auckland.ac.nz/users/upi111/unixhome/Downloads/dlim654_bpip078/runnable.jar!/application/view/PreviewSave.fxml`

As I am unable to create a creation, I cannot test the quiz functionality.

## Overall Comment

The overall look and feel of the application. The application looks like a full product that would be used in the real world. There is exquisite attention to detail and therefore has a very refined appearance. Great work!
