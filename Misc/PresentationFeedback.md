### Global feedback about the presentation from Assignment 3

See [our assignmnet:](https://github.com/dongmeilim/Assignment_3_206)

**PROS**

* Everyone did the functionality
* Introduced themselves
* Rehearsed and confident - interactivity between client and dev (what would you like to put in)
* Previewing capacity - for audio, images
* Well thought out video players
* Thoughts about the look and feel
* Enabling buttons when necessary
* Key bindings
* Opening screen

**CONS**

* Hadn't necessarily thought about the ease of the word flow
* needed to save files each time - can it not be automated?
* Cluttered screens with multiple functionality
* Audio list should either show the text or media controls to play the audio?
* App should be called VARpedia
* Default values for options - which the user can go change
* Predict saved video/audio names and change it if the file already exists
* Text size needs to be consistent for accessibility
* Who's the audience - justify your decisions
* Sometimes shortcuts were needed - this would be only known by technical people.
* Play with the font color, size, family and buttons - make it not Javaish
* If the search box is empty, why the user can press button.
* Difference between close and cancel, be specific
* Specifically say "Click the images to select"
* Descriptive names for voices - what does kaldiphone mean?
* What's the difference between kaldiphone and the nz one? Show why the choice matters.
* Let the user know what's going on when heavy tasks have started: Spinning things, progress bars etc
